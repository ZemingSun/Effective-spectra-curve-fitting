The data fitting was done using Genplot. Data.csv is the data file from Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy. 

I used two .mac files to model the spectra peaks. Plot1.mac mainly considers the chemical meaning of sub-peaks. Based on the literature review, I fit using 5 sub-peaks. The plot was shown in "Plot 1 Chemical 
consideration.png".

As comparison, Plot2.mac considers the math possibility of a sixth peak on the curve shoulder. The plot was shown in "Plot 2 Math consideration.png". This sixth peak could be a new finding with chemical 
structure meaning. 

In this project, I use the two kinds of fitting to demonstrate the importance of effective spectra curve fitting.
